This java Code allows you to screenshot one screen when multi screens are avaliable
it dose not require any liberys and nothing just run it and press 8 on your num-pad
it is worth nothing that you shoud clicke on the frame when taking the screenshot and it should be on the screeen you wanna take the screenshot of but still it is really easy simple code that solves some rare issue
Thank you !!
